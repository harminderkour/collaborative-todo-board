## üéØ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Register**: Create a new account with your name, email, and password
2. **Login**: Sign in with your credentials
3. **Dashboard**: Access the main Kanban board interface

### Task Management
- **Create Task**: Click "Add Task" to create a new task with title, description, priority, and assignee
- **Edit Task**: Click on any task to modify its details
- **Drag & Drop**: Move tasks between columns (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- **Smart Assign**: Use the lightning bolt icon to automatically assign tasks to the user with the fewest active tasks
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed

### Real-Time Features
- **Live Updates**: See changes made by other users instantly
- **Activity Log**: View the last 20 actions performed by all users
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits with merge options

## üß† Smart Logic Implementation

### Smart Assignment Algorithm
The Smart Assign feature automatically assigns tasks to the user with the fewest active (non-completed) tasks:

1. **Count Active Tasks**: Calculate active tasks for each user (excluding "Done" status)
2. **Find Minimum**: Identify the user(s) with the lowest task count
3. **Assign Task**: Automatically assign the task to the user with the fewest responsibilities
4. **Load Balancing**: Ensures even distribution of work across team members

### Conflict Handling System
When multiple users edit the same task simultaneously:

1. **Detection**: Server detects conflicts based on last modification timestamp
2. **Notification**: Both users are notified of the conflict
3. **Resolution Options**:
   - **Keep Your Version**: Discard other user's changes
   - **Accept Their Version**: Discard your changes
   - **Merge Changes**: Manually combine both versions field by field
4. **Validation**: Ensure data integrity after conflict resolution

## üîí Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with secure tokens
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Socket Authentication**: Secure WebSocket connections with token verification

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured experience with drag-and-drop
- **Tablet**: Touch-friendly interface with optimized layouts
- **Mobile**: Streamlined UI for small screens

## üé® Custom Animations

- **Card Hover Effects**: Smooth scale and shadow transitions
- **Drag & Drop**: Visual feedback during task movement
- **Loading States**: Elegant loading spinners and skeleton screens
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth navigation between views
